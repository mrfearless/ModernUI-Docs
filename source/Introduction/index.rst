ModernUI is a framework library and a collection of custom controls for win32 assembler, created to help modernize the standard win32 controls, and to add or emulate new control types and features of modern UX/UI designs and other graphical frameworks.

For years, new control types and UI designs for operating system and web have progressed, whilst older win32 base controls which are used by win32 assemblers (masm32 etc) have remained untouched. The ModernUI project has been created to help modernize these existing controls and add to them. The main goals of the project are:

* Provide a modern update to existing win32 base class visual controls.
* Add new control types to reflect newer UI/UX design influences.
* Emulate control types from UWP, WPF, .Net & Web 2.0 platforms.
